    <h2 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>

<p>I am a French pharmacist and a computer programming enthusiast.
I was firstly introduced in computer science during a university course. During this course, we were taught to code in HTML, to manipulate database, to make a presentation in PowerPoint and to write a report like a journalistic page.</p>

<p>As life goes on, I decided to live in South America and explored the tropical forest where I lived for a decade.</p>

<p>Back in France on December 2019, I restarted to learn computing environment on my own. Like in lots of fields, I’m much more a self-taught than a conventional learner.</p>

<h2 id="the-black-swan-year">The Black Swan year</h2>

<p>During the following years, even if I made many mistakes in the learning process, I took the “unknown” opportunity to get a deeper understanding about how to use a computer.</p>

<p>First lockdown came up with fear and despair, but you already knew about it. I kept calm and began to learn Python which became my favorite one. Indeed, learning alone is tough because you don’t have any teacher, or mentor to give you direction on how bad you have done it.</p>

<p>However, thanks to my scientific background, it helps me to have a more empirical approach.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-front-stage">On the front stage</h2>

<p>After a year of struggle with lockdowns and all connected matters, at the end of January 2021, I wasn’t sure about my progress. Furthermore, I needed new income, so I signed a contract for a year in a modern Strasbourg drugstore which supplies its drugs through a delivery robotic equipment. Obviously, I was back on track.</p>

<p>Along with my teammate, we faced lots of the common’s health professional problems of the pandemic: full of testing in a row, daily “unknown” RNA injections, massive crowd on the front, both server saturation and computer flaw, our own covid positive squad period, and more that could fulfill an entire post.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-code">Back to code</h2>

<p>My contract was terminated at the end of June 2022. I have passed a year with a few attempts to maintain my Python skills. 
I can’t stand to explore theses new paths of sharing and learning with you.</p>

<p>Take Care.</p>
