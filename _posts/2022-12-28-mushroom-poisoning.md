Human has cooked and used mushrooms since ancient times.
Even if mushrooms were appreciated for their culinar aspects, they were also used for magical or therapeutical activities.

Nowadays, people sometimes prefer to gather mushroom by their own and the majority eats poisonous mushrooms because they don't have the knowledge to recognize the toxic one.

Nowadays, magic mushrooms are used illegally for their psychotropic effects. The experience can go really bad and some consumers has been under psychiatric treatements for the rest of their life.

Research about therapeutical usage and bio product is on the move.

## 1. Edible vs poisonous

### 1.1 Potential applications of medicinal mushrooms

Here is a list extract from the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute on an article: Edible Mushrooms for Sustainable and Healthy Human Food, [[1]](#references).

+ Food consumption
+ Cosmetics (skin care formulations)
+ Biosorbent or bio-degradator
+ Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles
+ Bio-fertilizers
+ Therapeutic properties
+ Production of cellulolytic enzymes
+ Bioethanol production
+ Edible mushrooms based-films
+ Biomedical applications

### 1.2 Poisonous mushrooms

The probability of eating toxic mushrooms is high.

As far as I remember, my university professor taught us that the path to the recognition of mushrooms is hard and you must yearly update your knowledge. Both on theoretical and practical ways.

Research is focusing on deeplearning algorithm to help people to indentify toxic mushrooms.
There is an interesting article about it.
You can download the pdf article here: [cnn_classification.pdf]({% link download/cnn_classification.pdf %}).

Research is using deep convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN are a multilayer of neural that recognizes visual patterns directly from pixel images.
You will find an interesting article on Medium about it [[2]](#references).

## 2. Type of intoxication

There are six major types of intoxication by poisonous mushrooms.

For more informations you will find a link in the references section about groups of poisonous mushrooms [[3]](#references).

### 2.1 Cytotoxic mushroom

**Amanita** and **Cortinarius** species are nephrotoxic and  hepatoxic.

+ Amanita species contain **amanitin**.
+ Cortinarius species contain **orellanine**.

### 2.2 Neurotoxic mushroom

Agaricales mushrooms belong to this neurotoxic class: Amanita, Clitocybe, Inocybe, Psilocybe, Gymnophilus.
According to species, they contain: psilocybine, muscarines and isoxazoles.
Hallucinogenic mushrooms belong to this class.

### 2.3 Myotoxic mushroom

They cause rhabdomyolysis which is a degradation of the skeletal muscle.
Russula and Tricholoma species are myotoxic.

### 2.4 Metabolic, endocrine mushroom

Polyporic mushroom causes this type of clinical syndromes.
Medic reports: pancytopenia, trichothecene, GABA-blocking, disulfiram-like effect, hypoglycemia and hyperprocalcitoninemia.

### 2.5 Gastrointestinal irritant mushroom

This is a common effect of several mushroom intoxication.

## 3. Example of two active substances

### 3.1 Orellanine

Orellanine is a nephrotoxic toxin who is synthetize by mushroom species of Cortinarius genus. Cortinarius grow in Europe and North America. [[4]](#references)
One characteristics of intoxication is the apparition of symptoms at least 2 weeks, sometimes 1 month, after the ingestion. That is a serious problem for the identification of the cause of hospitalization.
There is no pecific antidote and half patients die. Others suffer from chronic renal insufficiency and need lifelong dialysis.

### 3.2 Psilocybine

Despite their festive consumption, magic mushrooms has some therapeutic potential.

You can refer to [the therapeutic potential of psilocybin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8156539/) and [psilocybine on Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/10624).

Trial suggests that they can treat sever depression. Major problem for this kind of therapy, as it was the case for ayahuasca, is the strict protocol that patients need to be aware.

## 4. Treatment of the death cap intoxication

The Dorosz edition, a french clinical dictionary, describes only on specific treatment for the intoxication by the Amanita phalloides.
With supportive care, doctor can use **silibinin**.

You can refer to [silibinin on Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/31553).

In addition with antiemtic drugs and rehydration or anticholinergic agents such as glycopyrrolate or atropine. All that depends on the clinical evaluation.

In a global view, the prognosis depends on which mushroom has been ingested.
