Human has cooked and used mushrooms since ancient times.
Even if mushrooms were appreciated for their culinar aspects, they were also used for magical or therapeutical activities.

Nowadays, people sometimes prefer to gather mushroom by their own and the majority eats poisonous mushrooms because they don't have the knowledge to recognize the toxic one.

Nowadays, magic mushrooms are used illegally for their psychotropic effects. The experience can go really bad and some consumers has been under psychiatric treatements for the rest of their life.

Research about therapeutical usage and bio product is on the move.

## 1. Edible vs poisonous

### 1.1 Potential applications of medicinal mushrooms

Here is a list extract from the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute. The link to the full article is at the end of the post in the bibliographies section.

+ Food consumption
+ Cosmetics (skin care formulations)
+ Biosorbent or bio-degradator
+ Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles
+ Bio-fertilizers
+ Therapeutic properties
+ Production of cellulolytic enzymes
+ Bioethanol production
+ Edible mushrooms based-films
+ Biomedical applications

### 1.2 Poisonous mushrooms

The probability of eating toxic mushrooms is high.

As far as I remember, my university professor taught us that the path to the recognition of mushrooms is hard and you must yearly update your knowledge. Both on theoretical and practical ways.

Research is focusing on deeplearning algorithm to help people to indentify toxic mushrooms.
There is an interesting article about it.
You can download the pdf article here: [downloadpdf]({% link download/cnn_classification.pdf %}).

Research is using deep convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN are a multilayer of neural that recognizes visual patterns directly from pixel images.

## 2. Type of intoxication

There are six major types of intoxication by poisonous mushrooms.

### 2.1 Cytotoxic mushroom

**Amanita** and **Cortinarius** species are nephrotoxicity and  hepatoxicity.

+ Amanita species contain **amanitin**.
+ Cortinarius species contain **orellanine**.

### 2.2 Neurotoxic mushroom

Agaricales mushrooms belong to this neurotoxic class: Amanita, Clitocybe, Inocybe, Psilocybe, Gymnophilus.
According to species, they contain: psilocybin, muscarines and isoxazoles.
Hallucinogenic mushrooms belong to this class.

### 2.3 Myotoxic mushroom

They cause rhabdomyolysis which is a degradation of the skeletal muscle.
Russula and Tricholoma species are myotoxic.

### 2.4 Metabolic, endocrine mushroom

Polyporic mushroom causes this type of clinical syndromes.
Medic reports: pancytopenia, trichothecene, GABA-blocking, disulfiram-like effect, hypoglycemia and hyperprocalcitoninemia.

### 2.5 Gastrointestinal irritant mushroom

This is a common effect of several mushroom intoxication.

## 3. Example of two active substances

### 3.1 Orellanine

nephrotoxic toxin
mushroom species of Cortinarius genus
Europe and North America
1950: mass poisoning in Poland
characteristics of intoxication: delayed symptoms after 2 weeks
no specific antidote
dialysis, chronic renal insufficiency for patients who survive.

### 3.2 Psilocybin

therapeutic potential

## 4. Treatment of the death cap intoxication

Amanita phalloides
Silibinine
Supportive care
activated charcoal
antiemetics in addition with rehydration
anticholinergic agents such as glycopyrrolate or atropine
differential diagnostic
prognosis depends on which mushroom has been ingested
