I have always been filled with Chinese culture.

As in any foreigner language learning, especialy for chinese, you need to set up a new way of thinking.

One of the most difficult part of learning chinese language is to remember the correspondance between the characters and its pinyin signification.

Pinyins are the phonetic transcription of chinese characters.
More informations on [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin)

Testing your knowledge is an important part of the learning process.
Being active is the path to sucess.

I am also a python enthusiast.
How can we make a simple dictionary to store our fresh chinese knowledge ?

I will use Python version 3.10.6 and two famous python libraries for webscraping : requests and beautifulsoup4.

Our target will be a html table from a website which refers to the HSK level 1 vocabularies list.

HSK is the Chinese Proficiency Test.

## First Step : create a virtual environment

Learning how to create and work with virtual environment is a good habit to take. 

Setup the environment :

    $ pip install virtualenv                # Install virtualenv using python 
    $ cd my_folder                          # Wherever you want to put the virtual enviroment folder
    $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv   # Create the environment, with the Python 3.x interpreter
    $ source venv/bin/activate              # Active the environment

<br>

## Second step : install the libraries

Requests : *Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.*

More informations on [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).

Beautifulsoup4 : *Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages.*

More informations on [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).

A good practice is to create a requirements.txt which contains the packages.

requirements.txt file:

    beautifulsoup4>=4.11.1
    requests>=2.28.1


Now install the packages:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Third step : the code

Create a main.py file with the following code.

```python
import json
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs

def extract_data(url):
    """Send a GET request to url
    return the raw text
    """
    return requests.get(url).text

def transform_data(url):
    """find td tags for chinese characters and pinyin
    return a dictionary 
    """
    soup = bs(extract_data(url),"html.parser")
    sinograms_list = soup.find_all("td",{"width":"179"})
    sinograms_list = [sino.get_text() for sino in sinograms_list ]
    pinyins_list = [soup.find_all("td",{"width":"90"})]
    pinyins_list = [p for p in pinyins_list[0]]
    pinyins_list = [p.get_text() for p in pinyins_list]
    return dict(zip(sinograms_list,pinyins_list))

def load_data(url):
    """Save the data in a json file
    """
    with open("sino_pinyin.json","w",encoding="utf-8") as f:
        json.dump(transform_data(url),f)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = "https://www.chineseinstitute.fr/formation-chinois/particuliers/cours-de-chinois-adultes/preparation-hsk-bct/hsk-test-de-niveau-de-chinois/hsk-niveau-1/hsk-1-vocabulaire-a-connaitre"
    load_data(url)
```

<br>

## Final step : launch the code.

From the terminal tape.

```sh
python main.py
```
