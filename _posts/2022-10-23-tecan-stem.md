According to the nomenclature of international non-proprietary names (INNs) established by the World Health Organization (WHO), the INNS of cytotoxic antineoplasic drugs belonging to the group of topoisomerase I inhibitors end in the common stem **-tecan**.

We have identified 4 drugs whose INN contains this common stem and which are authorised for the treatment of various cancers.

Two of these drugs have been marketed since 1990s: *irinotecan*, with a pegylated liposomal formulation since 2017 (Onivyde째 pegylated liposomal); and *topotecan* (Hycamtin째 or other brands) which is chemically similar to *irinotecan*.

More recently, two products consisting of monoclonal antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor have been authorised in the European Union: *sacituzumab govitecan* (Trodelvy째); and *trastuzumab deruxtecan* (Enhertu째).

It is likely that the cytotoxic drug in these two conjugates will have an adverse effect profile similar to that of *irinotecan*, mainly consisting of effects common to cytotoxics, including dose-limiting haematological disorders and severe prolonged diarrhoea, as well as early-onset acute cholinergic syndrome, skin rash, hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and thromboembolic disorders.
