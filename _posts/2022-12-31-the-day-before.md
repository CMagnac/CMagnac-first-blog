Although the infection has been under control since a few months in many countries, China remains the place where the virus has a significant impact.

Two major health politics has been applied.

The first was to make the virus circulate in the population to reach a so called "group immunization". At least 70% of the population needs to be infected by Covid-19, that may change according to virulence. Most of countries chooses the option.

The second, was to block the circulation of citizens and use mass testing when a case was detected. That's the China zero Covid policies. Now we can assure that it was a failure.  

## 1. Figures about Covid-19

Here are some figures extract from the World Health Organization (WHO) Covid-19 dashboard on the 12th of December 2022:

+ 651.918.402 confirmed cases
+ 6.656.601 deaths
+ 13.073.712.554 vaccine doses

Compared to "the flu" which causes 290,000–650,000 deaths per year.
Eventually, these data demonstrate the inconsistent prediction of some health-care professional in the earlier stage of the outbreak (march 2020 in France).

Also, it pointed out our weakness of data interpretation and trustful behaviour in algorithms prediction.
Nevertheless, human has demonstrated their ingeniosity in the quickest development of a new kind of vaccine.*

Primary prevention (washing hands, wearing mask, respect social distance) remain the best attitude to protect yourself and others.

Otherwise, vaccination is strongly recommanded for comorbidity patients (asthmatic, diabetic) and the elderly.

## 2. Vaccine

On September 4, 2022, Chinese health authorities approved the use of an innovative vaccine produced by the CanSino Biologics laboratory in the city of Tianjin. Convidecia® Air is a non-replicating viral vector vaccine. It is the aerosol version of the intramuscular injection against Covid-19. This vaccine is administered with a nebulizer at one fifth of the dose of the injectable version.

Mucous membranes are the main point of entry for many pathogens. Covid-19 is primarily transmitted through the emission of respiratory droplets that infect the nasal, oral, and conjunctival mucous membranes. The nasal route is a vaccination route that is already practiced for influenza vaccination of children. The advantages of nasal vaccines are their cost, ease of administration, and production.

The immunity acquired after an intramuscular injection is less effective at the level of the nose, mouth, and lungs. Mucous vaccines trigger an immune response at the level of the mucous membrane of the nasal and oral cavities. These new vaccines would provide a stronger immune response at the point of entry of the virus.

Airfinity, a health analysis company based in London, has already listed a hundred mucous Covid-19 vaccines under development around the world. China, India, and Iran are among the countries that are in Phase 3 studies.
