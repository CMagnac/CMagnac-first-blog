Leprosy is a serious skin disease that could lead to irreversible skin damage and social isolement.

Despite a few cases arround the world, there are still cases countries such as Brazil and India.

The earliest the diagnosis is the best is the chance of patients to recover a normal life.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) could really help health professional to establish an earlier diagnosis.

## 1. What is leprosy ?

Leprosy is the disease name of a bacteria infection due to *mycobacterium* gender. This gender includes tuberculosous and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).

Leprosy disease is a man to man transmitted infection.

The bacterial agent, *mycobacterium leprae* was discovered by Hansen in 1873 and is an acid-fast bacillus (AFB).

One of it clinical characteristic is the formation of a granuloma by the host.

The year incidence of leprosis is 250.000 cases, which most of them are in Brazil. Human and armadillo are the main natural reservoir of the disease. Some of brazilian community are eating armadillo that's why most cases are in Brazil location. [[1]](#bibliographies)

We can call this problematic: the cultural aspect of the public health prevention. Another striking example: frugivore bats are probably the natural host of Ebola virus. Human infect themselves by manipulating the meat wild animals who has been closed to bats.

Also, reckless deforestation increases the opportinity to crossing barrier species. We have all live that situation, which is one of the explanation of how the Covid infected people.
The signs and symptoms can be consulted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [[3]](#bibliographies)

## 2. Number of new cases

I find some data about comparison of 2019 and 2020 for countries with the highest number of new cases.

Data are from the World Health Organization.
[[4]](#bibliographies)

You can download the csv file [leprosy_data.csv]({% link download/leprosis_data.csv %}).

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
number_of_new_cases_2019 = df['number_of_new_cases_2019']
number_of_new_cases_2020 = df['number_of_new_cases_2020']
index = ['IN','BR','ID','CD','BD','SO','ET','NP','MZ','MM']
num2019 = list(number_of_new_cases_2019)
num2020 = list(number_of_new_cases_2020)
idx = list(index)
df = pd.DataFrame({'2019': num2019,'2020': num2020}, index=idx)
ax = df.plot.bar(rot=0)
```

I use alpha-2 code on abscissa to make the previous graph readable.
Here are the table code:

| Alpha-2 Code   |     Country                      |
| :------------: | :------------------------------: |
|   IN           |      India                       |
|   BR           |      Brazil                      |
|   ID           |      Indonesia                   |
|   CD           |      Democratic Republic of Congo|
|   BD           |      Bangladesh                  |
|   SO           |      Somalia                     |
|   ET           |      Ethiopia                    |
|   NP           |      Nepal                       |
|   MZ           |      Mozambique                  |
|   MM           |      Myanmar                     |

## 3. Treatment

The tree main drugs are: rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine.
Other antibiotics can be use: ofloxacin, minocycline, clarithromycin.

Duration of treatment: 6 months for paucibacillary (PB), 1 year for multibacillary (MB).

Hypersensitivity remains the major side effects, appears in 4 and 5 % of the population and increases in 25 % of HIV positive patients.

## 4. Artificial Intelligence

AI could be used to accelerate diagnosis of leprosy. Using images in the field of dermatology could potentialy help health worker to make a quickest diagnosis.

AI4Leprosy combines skin images and clinical data and was used in a clinical trial including brazilian patients.
