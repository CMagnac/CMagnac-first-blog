The health care sytems face several difficulties in how to exchange medical and financial informations.
Implementing standards for communication is one of the solution.
HL7 standards has been builted for this purpose.

## Health Level Seven

HL7 is an acronym, it means Health Level Seven. This language works on the seven layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

Now, lets have a look on the history of HL7 foundation.

<br>

## A brief history

The HL7 is a non-profit American National Standards Institute (ANSI). It was founded in 1987 by a group of hospital information technology users in the USA. Their purpose was to produce a standard for the exchange of data with hospital information systems.

HL7 has become the globally authoritative standards development organization (SDO) healthcare systems interoperability.

Since 1994, the HL7 International organization has been accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a Standards Developing Organization (SDO) for the USA.

2300 members in 55 countries contribute in the developpment of HL7 standards.

## About communication standards 

Information communication is a key component in any system.

There are five main challenges which complicate the information exchange.

+ Exponential increase of interfaces with the connected systems.
+ Difference of technologies and development languages use to build the architecture of systems.
+ Complexity of the informations exchange between the interfaces.
+ Structute of communication e.g the syntax.
+ Meaning of communication e.g the semantics.

One of the solution is to use a standard language that provides the **interoperability** between systems or components.

## Interoperability

*The ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged*.

Exchange is known as **functional** interoperability, whereas the capacity to understand and use shared information is called **semantic** interoperability.

Altough the solutions may appear to be more complex to implement, they can be adapted and scaled to many different scenarios, thus providing an essential framework for growth.

## Steps for development

Specific HL7 International Work Groups concentrate on various areas or "domains" of healthcare information exchange.

The output of the Work Groups must get the consensus and approval of a representation of the HL7 International membership before a standard may be published.

A healthcare interoperability standard is generally developed in five stages : 

+ Identification of issues and scopes. 
+ Conceptualization of a solution.
+ Create the standard specification.
+ Adoption by the rest of the industry.
+ Certification for some cases.
