Exchanging medical and financial information among healthcare systems increases the need for standards.

That's the reason why HL7 was developed in 1994.

## 1. Meaning and history of HL7

HL7 is an acronym that stands for **Health Level Seven**.
The number seven refers to the seventh layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model where it operates.

HL7 is a non-profit organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a Standards Developing Organization (SDO).

It was founded in 1987 by a group of hospital information technology users in the USA with the purpose of producing a standard for the exchange of data with hospital information systems.

HL7 has become the globally recognized Standards Development Organization (SDO) for healthcare systems interoperability.

> What is interoperability ?
>
> *Interoperability refers to the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and use the exchanged information.*.

There are two types of interoperability.

**Functional** interoperability, which refers to the exchange of information, and **semantic** interoperability, which refers to the ability to understand and use shared information.

Since 1994, HL7 International has been accredited by ANSI as a SDO for the USA. It has approximately 2300 members in 55 countries who contribute to the development of HL7 standards.

Here is the link to the HL7 **official website** : [hl7.org](http://www.hl7.org/).

## 2. About communication standards

Information communication is a key component of any system.

There are five main challenges that complicate information exchange and need to be addressed.

The **exponential** increase in interfaces with connected systems, **differences** in technologies and development languages, the **complexity** of information exchange between interfaces, the **structure** of communication (e.g. syntax), and the **meaning** of communication (e.g. semantics).

One solution is to use a standard language that provides interoperability between systems or components.

## 3. Steps for development

HL7 International Work Groups focus on specific areas or "domains" of healthcare information exchange.

The output of the Work Groups must be approved by a representation of the HL7 International membership before a standard can be published.

A healthcare interoperability standard is generally developed in five stages: **identification** of issues and scope, **conceptualization** of a solution, **creation** of the standard specification, **adoption** by the rest of the industry, and **certification** in some cases.

In recent years, we have entered the era of big data.

Data is gathered, exchanged, collected, and secured in a variety of public and private institutions. Healthcare systems need a stable and standard way of communicating and storing their data.

Without standards, the situation can become chaotic.
