One of the most important skills of a pharmacist is to optimize both back and front office. That will lead to the best flow between material and human. The technical term is the storage management whose will be explain in this post.

I began to work as a professional pharmacist almost ten years ago. At this time, there wasn't all the informatic tools and this massive internet information which allow us to increase our productivity. Pharmacy software was far from having all the features that a team relied on nowadays.

The North has all the power on economy and technology. They are growing faster than the South, that's a fact.
Non governmental organization (NGO) and the open-source is one of the solution.

## 1. Type of software

Some organisation provides different type of software who could be free or not.

### 1.1 LibreOffice

It's the free equivalent of Microsoft office.
It's a must have on any platforms.
You can find the official website here: [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

### 1.2 Specific software

These are adapted to the management of a pharmacy.

The Management Sciences for Health (MSH) has a list of repositories who are related to electronic pharmaceutical management system.

### 1.3 GnuHealth

GnuHealth is a free health and hospital information system.

The hospital management information system is build with Python and work with Tryton. Tryton is a three-tier computer application plateform on top of which is built an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).

Along with the necessity of installing a software management, there are different tools to manage the stock.

## 2. Tools for storage management

### 2.1 Product sheet

This is the main tool to manage storage.

Goals of product sheet are:

+ order preparation
+ quantification of loss
+ following drugs consumption

A sheet for each drugs and quantities are noted in number of unities.
Related to the context, discuss on using a paper-based approach or an electronic patient monitoring system.

### 2.2 Dispense register

Register all dispense prescriptions.
Using a specific register for pharmacological classes such as HIV treatment.
Make a daily overview of the dispensation.

### 2.3 Inventory sheet

Make the achievement easier.
Gain a global vision of the stock.

## 3. Physical inventory of storage

Validate and correct stocks by using the inventory sheet.
Remove outdated drugs.
Manage the team to obtain a better storage management.
Ideal achievment: 1 inventory per month.
Minima achievment: twice a year.
There mustn't be any delivery during the inventory. It must be realize at once.
The stock is consider right when the inventory deviation doesn't exceed 5%.
inventory deviation = (physical stock - theoritical stock) x 100 / physical stock
